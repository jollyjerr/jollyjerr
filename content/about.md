# About Me

I'm a programmer who spends a lot of time thinking about distributed systems, cross-platform apps, low-maintenance code, and technical team leadership.

I created this blog to share the lessons I wish I would have known earlier in my career, and to share the small insights I am learning while building complex systems at scale.

Currently I work as a Staff Software Engineer at [SmartRent](https://smartrent.com), where I build IoT solutions using the beautiful Elixir programming language.
