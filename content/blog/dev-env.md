# Crafting Your Perfect Development Environment: A Personalized Guide

> Learn to identify your unique dev style and build a local setup that maximizes productivity.

As a programmer you spend **thousands** of hours at the computer.

You have one life, you are spending a significant portion of it writing **JavaScript**, *and* you still don't take the time to hand craft a personalized local development environment?

This could save you years of your life. And if you are a young programmer just getting started, a proper development environment that fits your style is an investment that will compound your skills fast.

Ask any senior+ dev to explain what tools they use and why they use it, and I grantee they will have strong opinions on every detail and configuration of every tool installed on their system - and more opinions on the tools they don't install!

## Step One: Figure Out Who You Are

Over the years, I have identified four unique types of programmers. Find the style that is most similar to you. You can always pick a new style later, or create your own!

### The Novice

A Novice does not have a mental map of the tools they need to complete different programming tasks, and the tools they use either work or break depending on the will of the gods.

This is where we all begin, and there is nothing wrong with that! Some people choose to stay here, and that can actually be a valid choice in some situations.

You may be a **novice** if you don't know the difference between a `JDK` and a `JVM`.

### The Captive

A Captive works in a technology stack or for a company where tooling is predetermined. They have no choice but to conform.

You may be a **captive** if you know `Objective-C` or `X++`.

### The Surfer

A Surfer goes with the flow. They get very good at whatever the latest hotness is, and often are excellent and productive engineers that become more powerful as the tools improve.

You may be a **surfer** if your Claude bill is currently higher than your MRR.

### The Hermit

The hermit voluntarily lives on their own and creates their own personalized environment that nobody else would even understand.

You may be a **hermit** if you can explain the difference between `:w` and `:wa`.

## Step Two: Pick Your Operating Systems

You can start with a single primary OS, perhaps the one you use for work or school, and then scale out to handle multiple operating systems over time.
