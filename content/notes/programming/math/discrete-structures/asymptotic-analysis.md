# Asymptotic Analysis

See existing notes [here](../../programming/computer-science/asymptotic-analysis.md)

Analysis happens primarily for computer algorithms but you you need to know if a
function is big O of another function in an abstract sense. Basically, is the
function always bounded above by the other function regardless of input.

Proving a function bounds another involves setting up an inequality and
transforming it so that it is obvious.

todo: what is a "witness" in a proof like this? idk

O is bounds above
Ω is bounds below
Θ is grows at the same rate
