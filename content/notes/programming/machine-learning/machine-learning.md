# Machine Learning

A field of study in the intersection of data science and artificial
intelligence. Use statistical models and learning algorithms to train from data.

- supervised learning: train with labeled data to learn how to predict
  labels.
- unsupervised learning: train with unlabeled data to learn underlying features
  and information from the data.
- reinforcement learning: learn desired behavior from experience with reward and
  punishment.

## Interpretability vs. Flexibility

In general as models become more flexible they proportionally lose their
ability to be interpreted. Normally in real life situations the interpretation
of the effect of features can be just as important as model accuracy.

## Tasks:

Supervised:

- Prediction
  - Classification: binary or multi-class
  - Regression: real variables

Unsupervised:

- Clustering
- Anomaly detection
- Dimensionality reduction

Other:

- Data generation
- Feature selection
