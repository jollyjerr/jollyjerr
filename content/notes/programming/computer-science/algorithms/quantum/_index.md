# Quantum

All quantum algorithms will give you the wrong answer some of the time, but can be
made negligibly small probability - especially if you repeat the algorithm.

Quantum algorithms have solved some NP problems in polynomial time, but never an NP
complete problem - it is an open question if this relationship will hold.
