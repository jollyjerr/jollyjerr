# Networking

Super good tool for playing around with networking https://github.com/secdev/scapy

Tools for troubleshooting:

- ping (check if server is up and round trip time) uses icmp echo
- traceroute (path to destination) implemented with incremental ttl on multiple
  packets
- iperf3 (determine max throughput between client and server)
- iproute2
- iptables
- tc
- ipvsadm
- tshark
- wireshark
