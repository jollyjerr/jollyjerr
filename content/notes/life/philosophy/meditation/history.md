# History of meditation

High level, subjective, probably wrong, overview.

## Tantra

In India ~4000 bc the Tantrics invited Tantra. For anything to be manifest in
the world, we need focus and energy to make it happen.

- Mantra: phrases of power and "spells"
- Suntra: symbols of power
- Yanja: rituals to harness cosmic energy

They molded all these discoveries into Yoga.

## Yoga

Yoga originally had the goal to merge back into the infinite conciseness, Brahman.
Lose individuality by becoming one with our source. You could do that through
any of these paths, or mix and match.

- Bhakti: religion, beliefs, devotion
- Karma: doing good deeds
- [Jnana](./jnana.md): contemplation, sit and think your way to enlightenment
- [Raja](./raja.md): willpower, step wise process

Raja has eight steps:

1. Yama: societal observances
2. Niyamas: personal rules
3. Asana: postures to purify body and prepare for meditation
4. Pranayama: breath practices
5. Pratyahara: sensory withdrawal/control
6. Dharana
7. Dhyana
8. Samadhi

- Hatha: Raja systemic approach only needed Asana and Pranayama
- [Kundalini](./kundalini.md): 7 chakra system
- Kriya: like Hatha but focused on the mind, not body

## Buddha

Raja yogis were super involved with early Buddhism.

- Theravada: adhere to the original teachings of the Buddha
- Mahayana: believe there have been multiple Buddhas, learn from each (this is
  where zen comes from, and then mindfulness)
- Vajrayana: Tantric Buddhism

## Mindfulness

Mindfulness came from studies in the 60-90s that digested the key elements of
meditation and how we experience stress or allow our mind to wander. However the flavor and
specificity of some meditative techniques was lost.

Studies have shown mindfulness improves sleep, learning, stress, anxiety, aging,
self compassion, heart health, immune function, neuroplasticity, long term brain
pattern changes.
