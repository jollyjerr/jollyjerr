# Kundalini

Kundalini Yoga is focused on achieving specific goals.

This is where "chakra" comes from.

Listing the chakras here for historical/cultural context, not scientifically based
meditation practice, although there are specific practices for each chakra that
have shown to lead to specific types of results (obviously due to brain changes
not chakra alignment)

- muladhara

Base of the spine

Controls basic impulses and primal urges

- swadhisthana

Tail bone

Controls relationships and loneliness

- manipara

Controls agni (digestive fire)

The idea here is information and nutrition "becomes you" as it is
digested/processed

- anahata

Heart

Compassion and empathy

- vishuddha

Throat

The way we change the outside world

- ajna

"Third eye center"

Intuition and understanding (also understanding other people)
