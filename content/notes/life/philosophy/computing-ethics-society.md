# Computing, Ethics, and Society

## What is Ethics

Ethics definition in this context from
https://www.scu.edu/ethics/ethics-resources/ethical-decision-making/what-is-ethics/

First, ethics refers to well-founded standards of right and wrong that prescribe what humans ought to do, usually in terms of rights, obligations, benefits to society, fairness, or specific virtues. Ethics, for example, refers to those standards that impose the reasonable obligations to refrain from rape, stealing, murder, assault, slander, and fraud. Ethical standards also include those that enjoin virtues of honesty, compassion, and loyalty. And, ethical standards include standards relating to rights, such as the right to life, the right to freedom from injury, and the right to privacy. Such standards are adequate standards of ethics because they are supported by consistent and well-founded reasons.

Secondly, ethics refers to the study and development of one's ethical standards. As mentioned above, feelings, laws, and social norms can deviate from what is ethical. So it is necessary to constantly examine one's standards to ensure that they are reasonable and well-founded. Ethics also means, then, the continuous effort of studying our own moral beliefs and our moral conduct, and striving to ensure that we, and the institutions we help to shape, live up to standards that are reasonable and solidly-based.

## Kantianism (deontology)

To argue that an (action, policy, etc.) is ethical under the Kantian framework, you must show either that performing that (action, policy, etc.) doesn’t violate any universal moral rules and/ or doesn’t use others as mere means to an end.

- Decisions guided by universal moral laws, based on reason
- Good will is the only universal good
- Categorical imperatives, universal rules which everyone can follow
- Cannot use oneself or others as a means to an end

## Virtue Ethics

To argue that an (action, policy, etc.) is ethical under the Virtue Ethical framework, you must show that performing that (action, policy, etc.) is something someone with a morally virtuous character would not refrain from doing.

- Moral decisions based on fundamental moral virtues (depend on context)
- The right action is the one a morally virtuous person would do
- Vices are the opposites of virtue

## Utilitarianism

To argue that an (action, policy, etc.) is ethical under the utilitarian framework, you must show that the (action, policy, etc.) maximizes overall utility compared to available alternatives.

- An act is justified if it maximizes happiness and minimizes suffering for all
  parties involved
- motive for actions does not matter

## Social Contract Theory

- Behave in moral laws that we agree to accept for mutual benefit
- A rule is justified if everyone will follow it freely
