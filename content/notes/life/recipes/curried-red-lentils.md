- 1 cup red lentils
- 1 tbs soy sauce
- 1-2 tsp sugar
- 1-2 handfuls spinach

Turn pot to med low heat and add a few tbs of coconut milk. Add curry paste and stir until smooth. Do not burn. If too hot, add a little more coconut milk. When curry paste is evenly distributed throughout coconut milk, add the rest of the coconut milk and one can of water.

Add red lentils, soy sauce, sugar, and stir. Turn up heat and bring to boil. When boiling, turn down to low heat and simmer until lentils are cooked, stirring frequently so it doesn’t burn to bottom.

Can add a few squirts of lime juice if we have it
