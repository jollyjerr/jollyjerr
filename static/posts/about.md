# About me

I'm a full-stack engineer who loves building fantastic apps with great people. I harness the power of test-driven development combined with early user feedback and a growth mindset to solve problems with whatever tool is necessary.

I grew up in small-town Buffalo, Wyoming, where I balanced multiple passions for science, engineering, and music. ![Climbing in Idaho](https://ik.imagekit.io/jollyjerr/jtabb_dev/climbing_R2mdWU1pJ.jpg?ik-sdk-version=javascript-1.4.3&updatedAt=1652395182898&tr=w-1080%2Ch-566%2Cfo-auto) While obtaining my degree in music theory and composition, I discovered computer science for the first time and became instantly hooked. My compositions during college focused on humanity's ability to overcome the climate crises using technology - a theme I have continued to pursue during my engineering career.

After three years of self-taught programming, I knew I needed to further my technical education. I went straight from my college graduation to the Flatiron School in Denver, Colorado, where I studied full-stack web engineering and built multiple platforms from scratch in node, python, and ruby. ![Teaching algorithms to fellow flatiron students](https://ik.imagekit.io/jollyjerr/jtabb_dev/IMG_20190918_124925_glQsGWOu2.jpg?ik-sdk-version=javascript-1.4.3&updatedAt=1652395478610&tr=w-1080%2Ch-566%2Cfo-auto)

The rest of my career has been a blast. I have had the opportunity to write production code across many stacks - from natural language processing in python, optimized golang serverless functions, and highly concurrent elixir services to react dashboards, svelte-kit apps, and vue+nuxt storefronts. I have continued to pursue education through it all, reading many books on software architecture and finishing Stanford Online's Algorithm specialization.

Now, I work at SmartRent with a fantastic team writing elixir APIs and react-native apps. I believe developer experience and user experience go hand in hand, so I work hard to architect tested solutions that keep our stress levels low and user satisfaction high.

Even after all these years, I have the same mission and beliefs portrayed by my compositions in college. I believe in the power of technology that serves us, rather than distracts us, to overcome many of the challenges present in the modern-day.
