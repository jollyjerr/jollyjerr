# What I Use

## Workstation

- [16" MacBook Pro, 2.4ghz 8-Core i9, 32GB of RAM, AMD Radeon Pro 5500M 8GB Graphics (2019)](https://everymac.com/systems/apple/macbook_pro/specs/macbook-pro-core-i9-2.4-eight-core-16-2019-scissor-specs.html)

I have not even gotten the chance to use an M1 chip, but looking forward to it!

- [Philips 276E8VJSB 27" Monitor](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07JXCR263/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

I only use a single monitor so that I can stay focused. This Monitor is epic!
