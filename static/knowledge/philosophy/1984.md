# 1984

By George Orwell

Winston lives in Oceania and is self aware although the thought police are everywhere and big brother is watching and stuff. He falls in love with Julia who does not hate the government in the same way he does but also it does not really matter so they hang out and stuff. One day the thought police show they have known all about everything the whole time and then they torture Winston until he succumbs to doublethink and learns to love big brother.

I found this book to be less solid then Brave New World or the Handmaids Tale. I loved the idea of whoever owns the past owns reality - but I don't see it as being possible to the extent that the book displays. I like the twist where the thought police were actually way more advanced then they seemed the whole book.
