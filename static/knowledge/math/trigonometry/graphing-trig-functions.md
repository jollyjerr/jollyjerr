# Graphing trig functions

sin `y = asin(b(x + c)) + d`

cosine `y = acos(b(x+c)) + d`

tan `y = atan(b(x + c)) + d`

cot `y = acot(b(x + c)) + d`

a = the **amplitude** of the function = `|a| = max-min/2` the distance from the midline to top or bottom of the graph

in tangent, cosecant, secant, and cotangent, the emplitude is inf

b = the **period** of the funtion = `2pi/|b| for sin,cos,sec,csc` and `pi/|b| for tan,cot`
how long it takes for the function to complete a rotation and restart

c = horizontal shifts. positive c shifts the function to the left (subtract c from each x value) and negative c shifts to the right

d = vertical shifts. positive d shifts upward (add d to each y value) and negative shifts down

#### Combinations

Ex: `graph y = sinx + cos(2x)`

Graph both functions independantly and then use them to visualize and graph points of the combination

Finding points where the values are close together is the best
