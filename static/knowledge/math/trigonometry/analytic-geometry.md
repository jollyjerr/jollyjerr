## Parabolas

Analytic geometry of a porabola:

|             | Equation         | Vertex | Axis | Focus   | Directrix |
| ----------- | ---------------- | ------ | ---- | ------- | --------- |
| Opens up    | x^2=4py          | (0,0)  | x=0  | (0,p)   | y=-p      |
| Opens down  | x^2=-4py         | (0,0)  | x=0  | (0,-p)  | y=p       |
| Opens right | y^2=4px          | (0,0)  | y=0  | (p,0)   | x=-p      |
| Opens left  | y^2=-4px         | (0,0)  | y=0  | (-p,0)  | x=p       |
| Opens up    | (x-h)^2=4p(y-k)  | (h,k)  | x=h  | (h,k+p) | y=k-p     |
| Opens down  | (x-h)^2=-4p(y-k) | (h,k)  | x=h  | (h,k-p) | y=k+p     |
| Opens right | (y-k)^2=4p(x-h)  | (h,k)  | y=k  | (h+p,k) | x=h-p     |
| Opens left  | (y-k)^2=-4p(x-h) | (h,k)  | y=k  | (h-p,k) | x=h+p     |

If given an equation for a porabola like `x^2 - 4x - 4y = 0`:

1. Check if you have an x^2 term or y^2 term
2. Complete the square with respect to the squared term
3. Arrange your equation to resemble one from the chart above
4. Deduce the elements (pass in x=0 or y=0 to find intercept points)

```
x^2 - 4x - 4y = 0
x^2 - 4x = 4y    // -4/2 = -2 => (-2)^2 = 4
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4y + 4
(x-2)^2 = 4y + 4
(x-2)^2 = 4(y+1)
```

If given information about a porabola and asked to find the equation:

1. Sketch the graph
2. Plug in what information you have
3. Solve for the missing variables (like p)
4. Simplify the original (solve for y)

Note: I need to find a better source for this other stuff
