## Arc length

A good way to think about arcs is the definition of a radian. If you take the radius of a circle
and make it an arc length on the side of the circle, the resulting angle is one radian.

An arc length is always given by `s = r𝜭` where s is the length and r is the radius. 𝜭 must be in radians for this equation.

## Circular sector

The circular sector is the area inside an angle defining an arc length.

It can be calculated with `A = 1/2r^2𝜭`

## Trig functions of real numbers

When you see sint or sins it indicates a trig function being evaluated on a real number, not an angle

These can be called **circular functions**.

The real number is treated as if it is a radian

For example: Angular velocity `w = 𝜭/t`

```
w = pi/2 / 10 = pi/20 rad/s
```
