# Why calculus

> From "Calculus, An Intuitive and Physical Approach" by Morris Kline

Each branch of math is created to tackle a class of problems:

Algebra -> first, second, higher degree equations with unknowns

Plane and solid geometry -> data about common figures and relationships between them

Trigonometry -> size and distance of objects

Analytic geometry -> Use equations to study the paths of curves

Calculus ->

Motion of celestial bodies with **variable velocity and variable acceleration**.

Also, the **tangents to curves** to find the direction of the curve at a certain point.

Lengths of curves and the areas and volumes of figures bounded by curves.

Center of gravity of a body and the gravitational attraction exerted by bodies.

And many more...

## Primary concepts

Calculus uses algebra, geometry, trigonometry and coordinate geometry to define:

The **limit**, **derivative**, and **integral**.
