# Calculus

Calculus, originally called infinitesimal calculus or "the calculus of infinitesimals",
is the mathematical study of continuous change.

It has two major branches, differential calculus and integral calculus;
differential calculus concerns instantaneous rates of change, and the slopes of curves,
while integral calculus concerns accumulation of quantities, and areas under or between curves.
These two branches are related to each other by the fundamental theorem of calculus.
