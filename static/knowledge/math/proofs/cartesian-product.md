## The Cartesian Product

It is possible to multiply two [sets](./sets.md) and produce a new set, the **Cartesian Product**

A cartesian product of two sets, A and B, is another set, denoted as A x B,
and defined as `A x B = {(a,b): a ∈ A, b ∈ B}`

Notice the **ordered pair** in this definition

Ordered pairs can contain anything (numbers, letters, sets, other ordered pairs) and equality
is dependent on order `(2,4) != (4,2)`

You can also have ordered triples `(x,y,z)` etc...

A _Cartesian plane_ is just the cartesian product R x R. `{(x,y): x,y ∈ R}`

Expanding on this, you can have a **Cartesian power** like `A^n`

```
A^n = A * A * A ... * A = {(x1,x2,...,xn): x1,x2,...,xn ∈ A}
```
