## Sets

All of mathematics can be described with sets. A **set** is a collection of **elements**. Sets can be infinite or finite.

Sets are equal if they contain the same elements - even if they are listed in a different order.

`A = {1,2,3}`

2 ∈ A (read as 2 is in A)

Some sets are special and get reserved symbols:

- N = All natural numbers
- Z = All integers
- R = All real numbers
- ∅ = The empty set
- Q = The rational numbers `Q = { x: x = m/n, where m,n ∈ Z and n ≠ 0 }`

Sets can have anything as elements (numbers, strings, other sets, functions), or nothing, which makes them equal to the _empty set_ or ∅.

The cardinality of a set is marked with ||. `|{1,8}| = 2`

**Set-builder notation** is used to describe sets that are hard to write out in full. `X = {expression:rule}` Example:

```
E={2n:n∈Z}

Read: "E is the set of all things of form 2n, such that n is an element of Z"

Translation: E is the set of all n in (all integers) where n is even
```
