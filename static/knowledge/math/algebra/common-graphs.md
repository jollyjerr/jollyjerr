### Parallel/Perpendicular lines

If you have a line `y = 2x + 1`

A Parallel line is: `y = 2x + anything`

A Perpendicular line is: `y = -1/2x + anything` (use the negative reciprocal of the slope)

### Porabolas

Two primary notations:

Standard form: `y = ax^2 + bx + c` axis of symmetry is -b/2a

Vertex form: `y = a(x-h)^2 + k` vertex is located at (h,k)

To convert standard to vertex, [complete the square](./factoring.md). To convert vertex to standard, expand the square.

### Circles

Standard form: `(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2`

The center is located at `(h, k)`

The radius is `r`

Sometimes, to get an equation of a cirlce to standard form, you will need to complete the square for both x and y.

### Comparing two points

You can find the distance between two points by drawing a right triangle and using `(x1 - x2)^2 - (y1 - y2)^2 = c^2`

You can find the midpoint between two points with `m = ((x1 + x2)/2, (y1+y2)/2)`
