- Powers of negative bases

```
-5^2 = -25, -(5)^2 = 25
```

- Powers of fractions

```
(a/b)^3 = a^3/b^3

(sqt2/4)^3 = 2*sqt(2)/64 = sqt2/32
```

- Negative exponents

`a^-b = 1/a^b` and `1/a^-b = a^b`

- Fractional exponents

`x^4/3 = (3sqt(x^4))`

- Rationalizing denominattors

rules

```
sqt(a/b) = sqta/sqtb

sqt(ab) = sqta * sqtb

sqta * sqta = a
```

example

```
1/sqt2

1/sqt2 * sqt2/sqt2

1sqt2/2

sqt2/2
```

- Conjugate method

If your denominator is an irrational [polynomial](./polynomials.md), you can multiply the fraction by it's _conjugate_.

```
3/(5 - sqt3) = (3/(5-sqt3)) * ((5+sqt3)/(5+sqt3))
```

Distribute, and then simplify
