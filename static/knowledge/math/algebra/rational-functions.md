```
f(x) = (x^2 + 2x - 7)/(x - 2)
```

You can simplify with [long devision of polynomials](./polynomials.md)

You can also simplify with cancelation

```
4(a-3)/4 = (4/4)(a-3) = a-3
```

#### Addition and subtraction

Same as normal fractions - find a common denominator and add or subtract the numerator

#### Multiplication

Factor out both sides and use cancelation to simplify the equation. If you cancel a factor in the
denominator that limits the [domain](./functions.md) of one of the functions, you need to explicitly provide that
limitation in your simplified form because it limits the domain of the product.

```
(4x^2 - 1)/(x^2 - 4) * (x-2)/(2x-1)

(2x+1)(2x-1)/(x+2)(x-2) * x-2/2x-1 // cancel out 2x-1 and x-2

2x + 1 / x + 2 with x != 1/2 or 2
```

#### Devision

1. Factor out both sides
2. List all restrictions. Keep in mind all areas of the equation that can not be 0 `(anything)/(x!=0) / (x!=0)/(x!=0)`
3. Multiply against the reciprocal of the devisor
4. Cancel common factors
5. List the solution with it's restrictions
