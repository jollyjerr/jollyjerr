Functions can be operated on following the [order of operations](./operations.md) just like
numbers and variables

```
sum          (f+g)(x) = f(x) + g(x)
difference   (f-g)(x) = f(x) - g(x)
product      (f*g)(x) = f(x) * g(x)
quotient     (f/g)(x) = f(x) / g(x)
composite    (fÂ°g)(x) = f(g(x))
```

### Inverse functions

If you have a "one to one" function (a function that always has one output for one input)
you can find that functions **inverse** (the function that _undoes_ it)

`x = f^-1(f(x))`

Find the inverse of `f(x) = 2/3x - 4` by swapping the variable and solving for y

```
x = 2/3y - 4
...
y = 3/2x + 6
```
