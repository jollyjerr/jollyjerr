- Expressions: just statements `abc + c^3 + ab` solve for a=2,b=-1,c-3
- Inverse operations: used to keep equations balanced `x+3-3 = x || sqrtx^2 = x`
- Equations: `x-3 = 10` -> `x-3+3 = 10+3` -> `x+0 = 13` -> `x = 13`

Simplify or evaluate **expressions**

Balance or solve **equations**

- Equations with parentheses:

```
12 - (2x+5) = -2 + (x-3) // remember understood 1 here in front of parentheses
12 - 2x - 5 = -2 + x - 3
7 - 2x = -5 + x
12 - 2x = x
12 = 3x
x = 4
```

- Words to keep in mind:

(\*) = sum, increases

(-) = difference

x = product

/ = quotient
