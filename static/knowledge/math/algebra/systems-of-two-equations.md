You can solve systems of two equations in three ways:

1. Substitution

Solve for either x or y in one equation, plug in your value to the other equation and solve for the other variable, plug in your solution to the first equation to find your unique answer (x,y)

2. Elimination

Get one term to cancel by adding the equations together, solve for the remaining variable, and plug your solution into the first equation to get (x, y)

3. Graphing

Graph the two equations and the answer is where the lines cross at point (x, y)
