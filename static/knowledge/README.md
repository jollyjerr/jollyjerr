# Knowledge

This is my [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) "second brain". A centralized place for notes on things I learn.

The goal here is not encyclopedic coverage, but rather quality reminders, highlights, and references.

> _Note:_ take everything with a grain of salt. This may be filled with mistakes, misunderstandings, lies, misinformation, and/or propaganda.
