> My notes are based on the Sutras, and "The Heart Of Yoga" by T.K.V Desikachar

Yoga is supa old - developed 5000 years ago in northern India

Anything this old is really, really, big, so my notes are mainly on Ashtanga yoga as codified by Patanjali.

Yoga has a minimal core, and complexities are built on top of that core. The core is not very religious at all, but some of the stuff that has been built on top of the core makes religious claims.

Yoga is built on a system of teacher -> student relationships instead of the study of texts, but the Sutras of Patanjali describe the core of yoga practice.

## What is yoga?

> The restraint of the modifications of the mind-stuff is Yoga.

Or, in other words, yoga is the _ability_ to direct your mind exclusively toward anything and sustain that direction without distraction.

The **goal** of yoga is a total freedom called _Kaivalya_ which is a permanent state of mental transparency and unrestrained curiosity. Someone who has obtained kaivalya
always observes everything accurately, is able to make perfect choices, and effortlessly avoids any action that would have distracting or disturbing consequences.

That is the core of yoga and a lot of teachings say you can basically stop there if you want. For example, any time you get in a flow state and focus so hard that everything else drops out of your mind you
are doing yoga - just not on purpose and you likely can only do that for a little bit before your mind gets distracted again. Yoga practices are proven ways to train yourself to maintain that state of focus longer
and gain the ability to chose what you focus on.

## Yoga practices

If you keep it simple, yoga teachings say to work on these 8 things all at the same time:

- Yama - our attitudes toward our environment
- Niyama - our attitudes toward ourselves
- Asana - the practice of body exercises
- Pranayama - the practice of breathing exercises
- Pratyahara - the restraint of our senses
- Dharana - the ability to direct our minds
- Dhyana - the ability to develop interactions with what we seek to understand
- Samadhi - complete integration with what we seek to understand

These are all connected, so working on any one of them is actually working on all of them. The order of this list explicitly does not matter.

### Yama

Yama comprises a consideration for all living things, especially those who are innocent and in difficulty. Yoga teaches that our relationship with others and the environment _reveals_ our state of mind.

> Changes of mind can be observed primarily in our relationships

### Niyama

Niyama comprises self reflection, cleanliness, physical and mental health, and the acceptance of our limitations.

Niyama is basically about not getting distracted by things, health problems, or other practical stuff so that you can focus on cultivating samadhi. Niyama can also include the respect of a higher power,
and/or using a religious system to gain grounding and direction in your life. Interestingly, the inclusion of a higher power is still just a means to an end - obtaining kaivalya.

### Asana

Asana and pranayama are the easiest places to begin yoga. In asana, you practice physical postures while focusing on your breath. The goal of each asana posture is to be fully strong and fully gentle.

The breath should be used to guide each posture and focus your mind, and your mind should also recognize and observer the reactions of your body and breath to each posture. The goal is just recognition
and focus. If postures cause you to lose control of your breath they are too advanced and you should rest and modify. Your should always be breathing deeply and slowly - ideally through the nose.

Asana has bonus perks of making you healthier and happier - but those are not the goal. For example, if asana helps you with back pain you should use this newfound freedom from back pain to explore
the original causes of the pain.

### Pranayama

Pranayama is a form of meditation where you sit and force specific breathing patterns. For example: inhale for 4 counts, hold for 2, exhale for 8, hold for 2 and repeat 12 times.

Pranayama, like asana, uses your physical body as a way to focus your mind. After practicing pranayama for a while you may focus the mind on any object while doing the practice - for example:
36 repetitions of 8 count in 16 count out while focusing your mind on your personal habits.

### Pratyahara

Pratyahara is mastery of your senses. It develops naturally as you practice and the obstacles to perception within us are cleared. Eventually all your senses should aid you in focusing
rather than distract you.

### Dharana

Dharana is the ability to direct your mind towards one object (of your choice) "against all odds". Think of studying for an exam while your house is on fire.

### Dhyana

Dhyana is a connection between you and the thing being understood. It literally is the same "flow state" we talk about in western culture.
Playing Fortnight so hard you forget to eat or go to the bathroom is dhyana between you and Fortnight.

Nobody can force dhyana - it is a mental state like sleep that we can only prepare the conditions for and hope it happens.

Asana and pranayama create favorable conditions for dhyana.

### Samadhi

Samadhi is a complete understanding of an object - to the point where your unconscious mind has mastery over it and you understand all aspects of it from every perspective.

Desikachar gives the example of doing dishes and suddenly knowing exactly how to write a 6 page essay you were working on for a class. If you can then just walk up and write the essay without stopping and it is excellent,
that is basically samadhi.

## Flux and agency

The only other thing I want to mention is yogas focus on _change_ and _agency_.

Yoga teaches that everything is always changing - and insight you gained from a state of samadhi last week is not necessarily valid this week.

Yoga also teaches that your actions are valuable and important intrinsically. So, no matter what other people think or even if nobody knows something you did it should still be important to you and is still useful
for obtaining kaivalya.
