# Animal Liberation

By: Peter Singer

## Ethics

Peter defends veganism philosophically by extending the "principle of equality" across all living things with a nervous system(ish). There is no valuable line you can draw where creatures above that line deserve not to be farmed and creatures below that line do.

## Experiments

Peter says we should only use animals for painful experiments when the situation is so dire that we also would use mentally undeveloped baby humans.

## Veggie diet

The science is extremely clear that humans can live long and healthy live off of nothing but plants. Therefore, eating animals or there secretions is a choice - not a need (for most humans in developed nations). When given the choice, we are ethically required to be consistent and extend the principle of equality to animals so that we are not speciesist and cause suffering for no reason. The only exceptions Peter sees could be **_totally_** free range eggs and muscles.
