# Jeremiah Tabb

I solve complex problems creatively. As a software engineer with a background in music composition, I have years of experience thinking outside of the box to implement technical solutions in environments that prioritize results. I am obsessed with learning, and strive to achieve the simplicity that comes through thorough understanding - be that in music or code.
