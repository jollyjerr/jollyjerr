## ðŸ‘‹ Welcome!

I harness the power of agile development to abstract complexity into ideal technical products. I get psyched when a problem is well suited for an automated and scalable software solution. My favorite tasks include structured and unstructured data processing in Python and Golang and creating expert dashboards with React.js.

I prioritize surrounding myself with brilliant people I can learn from (so let's connect!). I believe great minds focus on logistics, great organizations prioritize people over profits, and humanity has its most potential when diverse groups of people work together on specific problems.

When I'm not writing code, I love to compose music for films, experiment with new technologies, and climb really tall rocks.

### Skills/Interests:

JavaScript, Typescript, Python, Golang, React.js, Next.js, Gatsby, Vue, Nuxt.js, Svelte, Flutter, Docker, AWS, TailwindCss, Sass, Electron, Linux, Communication, teamwork, and flexibility.
