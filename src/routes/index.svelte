  <p class="text-xl">
    I am a full-stack engineer with a passion for turning complicated ideas into
    slick applications.
  </p>
  <p class="text-xl">
    Most of my time is spent understanding problems and building solutions using
    whatever tools necessary. I love writing client facing interfaces with
    React, Vue and Svelte. For server side work, I love Node.js, Golang, Python
    and Elixir.
  </p>
  <p class="text-xl">
    I live and work in Boulder, CO. If I am not coding, you can find my climbing
    rocks all around the US or at home learning a new skill.
