  <h3 class="text-2xl">ðŸ’¼ Experience</h3>
  <p class="text-xl">
    I spend the majority of my time building data-driven/iot applications with
    the awesome team at <Link href="https://smartrent.com/">SmartRent</Link>. I
    also work as an engineer for other projects - building modern applications
    with a variety of technologies.

    Previously, I have worked on computational linguistics pipelines to
    transform unstructured medical text into meaningful datapoints to assist
    with patient tracking and diagnosis. I have also spent time building custom
    functionality into the Microsoft Dynamics application suite.
