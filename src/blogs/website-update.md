# Welcome to my new website

For a long time, I have used a very simple single page application for my personal website that simply existed to link to other resources.
This worked great! I was able to spend very little time on custom code for my personal website and could spend more time writing content for Medium or thinking of my next clever tweet.

But recently it started to bother me that I spent so much time coding for other people and would not be bothered to spend a few days of work just working on _my_ image.

So, welcome to my new website! Obviously it is a work in progress and has a long way to go, but over the next few months you can expect to see it come into shape and really start looking good.

My priorities:

- Reach a "minimal viable product" soon
- Add dark mode
- Write out some of the blogs I have been wanting to write for the past year
- Add a comment system to my blog posts

Anyway - thanks for visiting my website, and I hope you will join me as I work to better my online image and provide valuable content for developers and composers!
