There's a short scramble to the ledge.  With bolts every seven or so feet, the route is fully protected.  Fun slab climbing with holds just where you want them.  I found the crux to be between the 5th an 6th bolts (I think), requiring a mantle off a small ledge to a blind reach overhead, landing me, thankfully, in a 3-finger sinker pocket.  The Rolofson book says the route is a 5.10, but he may not fully recall the route.  I thought is was more on the 5.9 side.

You could skip the first pitch by scrambling on top of the bench. <br>   <br>  P1. Ascend a 10&#39; finger crack to a large, right-facing corner.  Easy slab climbing leads to a bulge just below the &quot;Sick Flake&quot; and a large tree.  Belay at rap rings on a slung tree.  5.7. <br>   <br>  P2. Surmount the Sick Flake by either chimneying inside (easiest, and the only way to get pro) or laybacking the edge (great moves).  Once on top of the chimney, climb the steep, left-facing corner.  The holds are mostly huge, but it&#39;s steep and can give you a pump.  Belay at another set of bolted rap rings below a tree in the rotten band.  5.8. <br>   <br>  P3. Move slightly left, just above the tree and climb moderate cracks over an overlap.  Choose a path left across a nice face with large features and easy moves, but not much pro.  Belay on a huge ledge in the next rotten band.

      "description": "<div class=\"fr-view\">This is one of the most popular routes in Eldo, and for a good reason. It  is long, not too sustained, and a beautiful direct line. The climbing is all pretty straight forward.  The 5.10 variation on the second to last pitch is kinda stiff for .10a, but is really well protected  on bolts. The last pitch is runout but easy. The direct start is not too bad, more of a high  boulder problem than anything, although I had a friend who sprained his ankle on it once.   <br>   <br>  P1 direct. Scramble onto it and arrive shortly at some caked-on chalk and pin scars below a break in a long roof band. This was Kors original start; it is 5.10 and protects with tricky small stopper placements.  <br>   <br>  P1 standard. A much easier start ascends a short dihedral 20 feet to the right. Cut back left, then climb further up huge holds over the exciting roof, and head right to a tree belay-5.9 (about 30 feet  of elevation gain). <br>   <br>  P2. Go up left, then up a fantastic dihedral, with face moves at the end, to another tree, 5.8. <br>   <br>  P3. Head up cracks and corners to a rotten band; continue over a scary bulge and another crack to a beautiful, exposed ledge, also 5.8. <br>   <br>  P4. Fifteen feet right of the belay, ascend a large, moderate dihedral. Hand traverse right, avoiding a huge overhang, and climb another 5.8 corner up and then right to a small, exposed stance. You can also belay on a large ledge 10 feet lower with less exposure. <br>   <br>  P5. Climb straight up, make a delicate step right into a thin crack (with several pitons) and ascend that (the crux) to a scary detached flake [now gone]. Make a beautiful ascending 5.7 traverse up left to lower angle terrain and a belay on the arete, or climb straight up past bolts at 5.10 and reach the same belay. <br>   <br>  P6.

It has been a popular route for a long time and is quite historic. To reach the bottom of the climb, hike around to the North side of the Matron and follow a climber's trail up until you reach a large block. Chimney up between this block and the Matron and start on the bench immediately afterwards. The climb is roughly four pitches long - about 1.5 pitches of steep 5.6 on the North Face, and then easy scrambling to the summit on the East Ridge. <br>   <br>  P1: follow a left-leaning crack on the face past a few old rusty pins to a ledge with a small tree (5.6). <br>   <br>  P2: climb the short crack out onto the East Face, and belay on a ledge wherever convenient (5.6). <br>   <br>  From here, the climb is much like scrambling on the East Faces of any Flatiron and is easy, well-featured, and offers little pro.

Pitch one is a good lead of about 5.7 and is well suited for those getting into trad climbing on the Tower.  Pitch two is longer and is very sustained 5.8 climbing.  Both pitches swollow up gear and you can protect pitch 2 with as many hand-fist sized hexes and cams as you can carry.  The crux will prove to be the small bulge 2/3 up on pitch 2 and the slightly narrowing crack as it tapers toward the top of the route where it ends at the Meadows.  NOTE: This route can be rappelled with two ropes in two pitches, but it's recommended that you rappell in three pitches, the third being at the anchors at the ledge about 25-30 feet up from the start of the route.  Rappelling in two will increase the likelyhood of having your ropes hung up on the aformentioned ledge when it is pulled.</div><br /><img  class=\"\" src='https://cdn2.apstatic.com/photos/climb/109316557_smallMed_1494346406.jpg' alt=\"View from the paved trail near the halfway mark.\"><br><a href=\"https://www.mountainproject.com/area/105708960/wyoming\">Wyoming</a>\n        \n             &gt; <a href=\"https://www.mountainproject.com/area/105714267/devils-tower\">Devils Tower</a>\n        \n             &gt; <a href=\"https://www.mountainproject.com/area/105714384/south-and-east-faces\">S &amp; E Faces</a>",

      "title": "Tick: Northeast Ridge (5.6)",
      "description": "<div class=\"fr-view\">From the Andrew&#39;s Glacier trail, you will see the Sharkstooth to the south. Hike up the Gash, which is the large boulderfield between you and the rock. As you get near, there will be a long fin of rock coming off the northeast ridge and heading, guess which direction...northeast. Climb to the east of that and scramble up on some large ledges for the first pitch.<br> <br> P1. The first pitch can start in several places that are all about 5.4-5.6. I&#39;d say we ran about 160 feet of rope on the first pitch. There are probably several places you could rig a belay.<br> <br> P2. The second pitch was similar to the first 5.4-5.6 climbing, about the same distance and straight up the northeast ridge. Not a lot of zigzagging on this route. After some initial 5.5 climbing a long section of 5.easy climbing leads to a crux layback flake (&lt;10ft). Belay on top of the flake. On this pitch the terrain gets easier if you stay left, but avoid the temptation and go straight up. You will eventually see the flake. Alternatively if you veer left a bit you can find a good belay stance on a dirt/grass covered lege below and left of the flake about 30-50 feet and save the flake for the next pitch.<br> <br> P3. The third pitch goes 5.6 in the guidebook. Startup up a left-facing dihedral, and go more or less straight up, or possibly slightly right along a system of left facing dihedrals. The crux is just before the belay. 100-150&#39;.<br> <br> P4. Go up and slightly right along 5.easy terrain. Just before the end of the pitch there&#39;s a nice right slanting finger crack. Reach the first ledge/bench on the route and build the belay on the far side next to or in the wide crack. This pitch could likely be linked with the next with a 60m.<br> <br> P5. Pitch 5 starts up a wide crack, but I hung out on the face for most this, because I think offwidths are about as fun as getting beaten with a rubber hose. The climbing is a lot easier on these last two pitches. Also, the route is completely obvious here as well. The 5th pitch ends on another, somewhat smaller ledge. More people on the Petit...if only they knew what they were missing over here.<br> <br> P6. On the 6th pitch, there was little more loose rock and hollow holds, so be a little more cautious. From the top of #6, it&#39;s a very simple scramble to the summit. Ok, I was roped up, so what? But honestly, it&#39;s probably class 2 to the top from here.<br> <br> The top has a great view of the surrounding area. Also, a little less comforting, look down through the boulders on the summit on the west side. I swear I saw daylight through there. Anyway, head southeast from the summit and down a little gully to rap rings. There are 3 50-60 meter raps to the top of the Gash here. The rap rings looked pretty good. Don&#39;t forget to bring a second rope or you&#39;ll be downclimbing. Also, there seems to be a lot of loose rock that gets knocked down when you toss your ropes on each rappel so be prepared to shout &quot;ROCK!!&quot; often to the people below and watch for more of it when you pull your ropes. That&#39;s it. Down the Gash to the trail. Hope you enjoy it. Also, I gave this a grade III, because it took us 13 hours, but we took a 2 mile detour by going to the south side first and then backtracking around to the north side. It&#39;s probably somewhere between a II and a III.<br> <br> For an efficient party,<br> Base to summit time: 4 hours<br> Approach: 3 hrs<br> Descent from summit to base: 90 minutes.<br> Slow or inexperienced parties should increase these by 50%. Experienced parties should shoot for better time.</div><br /><img  class=\"\" src='https://cdn2.apstatic.com/photos/climb/110946571_smallMed_1494359310.jpg' alt=\"Sharkstooth.\"><br><a href=\"https://www.mountainproject.com/area/105708956/colorado\">Colorado</a>\n        \n             &gt; <a href=\"https://www.mountainproject.com/area/105744466/alpine-rock\">Alpine Rock</a>\n        \n             &gt; <a href=\"https://www.mountainproject.com/area/105744460/rmnp-rock\">RMNP - Rock</a>\n        \n             &gt; <a href=\"https://www.mountainproject.com/area/105745133/sharkstooth\">Sharkstooth</a>",

Give yourself plenty of time to do this one as four rappels are required to reach the ground. The summit is awesome and the upper pitches are high quality. The first few pitches aren't as fun and kind of mungy. <br>   <br>  From <a href='https://www.mountainproject.com/user/10121/charles-vernon'>Charles Vernon</a>: <br>   <br>  Approach by parking at the Glacier Gorge juntion trailhead (about a mile before Bear Lake) and follow the signs for about 4 miles to Sky Pond. Scramble up talus to the base of the Petit, which is overshadowed by the Sharkstooth. The Saber will be prominent to the right.  <br>   <br>  P1 - aim for a groove in the center of the steadily narrowing South Face, and climb that for a long easy pitch to a grassy ledge. <br>   <br>  P2 - enter a giant chimney in the center of the face and belay on top of a chockstone (5.6, 100 feet). <br>   <br>  P3 - take the left-slanting line out of the cave and belay on a large ledge below a smaller chimney (5.7, 140 feet). <br>   <br>  P4 - climb the chimney, then traverse right to a belay below the right end of a roof (5.6, 120 feet). <br>   <br>  P5 - head straight up at 5.9, or pull around to the right on easier rock (spotty pro either way). Climb up a steep crack, into a left facing corner with a beautiful finger crack, and proceed to a ledge on the east side of the Petit (sustained 5.8, 120 feet). <br>   <br>  P6 - climb up, head right and then back left to a small stance on the southeast arete--the Pizza Pan Belay (5.7, 130 feet). <br>   <br>  P7 - climb the crack above the belay to a ledge, and climb straight up the wall, then slightly up right to belay just below the ridgeline (or on it if you have enough rope) (5.7, 160 feet). <br>   <br>  P8 - gain the ridge, then follow it up to the spectacular summit (5.6 or 5.7, 80-90 feet). <br>   <br>  One more note of caution - some guidebooks describe a \"5.4\" variation to the right of the first five pitches of the route which purportedly bypasses the crux and leads straight to the south face. That is completely bogus - I have searched in every conceivable spot, and there is no way to bypass the traditional crux at 5.4 from the so-called \"second terrace\".

      "description": "<div class=\"fr-view\">I always thought this was the easiest route on Mt. Owen, but was surprised just now to find that it is not (the W Ledges route is 5.1). The only major technical difficulty is the summit block. You can begin this route either from Amphitheater Lake or from the summit of Teewinot. I recommend the former and I have not done the latter.<br> <br> For the standard approach from Amphitheater Lake, descend a ramp west to the Teton Glacier Moraine (tricky if snow-covered). You now must cross the end of this glacier, which is melted out and/or covered with unstable scree. Ascend the obvious couloir to gain the saddle west of Teewinot. This is snow-filled in early season, otherwise it is filled with loose rock. Half-way up the couloir there is a waterfall, move left to avoid this steep section. Helmets recommended for this section, watch for climbers above you.<br> <br> From the saddle head west up the east ridge, easy scrambling for the most part. Your next objective is to climb a cliff to gain access to Owen&#39;s upper snowfield, just below the summit block. The easiest option is to traverse right and climb a chimney. Now you need to make a long rising traverse left and up the upper snowfield to a point just south of the summit block. This snowfield ends in cliffs below you, so this section is deceptively dangerous. If it is melted off enough, it is usually safer to follow the rocks under the snowfield to a point where it can be climbed up directly. Practice your self-arrest before attempting this climb, or wait until it is all melted off.<br> <br> The final difficulty is to climb the summit block via the big chimney on the south side, which reaches the summit ridge west of the summit. Climb this chimney, and then move north to the west side of the peak where the final few feet are climbed from the west (via another wide chimney). As I recall, the entire summit block can be climbed in a single pitch.</div><br /><img  class=\"\" src='https://cdn2.apstatic.com/photos/climb/105934554_smallMed_1557951464.jpg' alt=\"Bill Wright on the First Ledge, Mt.

      "description": "<div class=\"fr-view\">This is one of the top three 5.11 trad climbs at the City.  The name is very fitting.  The crux is protected by a #2 Lowe ball.  Gear larger than 1/4 inch is not had until way after the crux.   <br>   <br>  Start by face climbing past a bolt. (Stick clip?)  Fire in some small bomber nuts, and stand up on the small ledge.  Place you #2 ballnut which can be backed up with a #2 RP a little lower.  A #.2 Camalot can be placed right after the crux lieback moves.  Thin pro, tough placements, and pumpy moves lead to a rest ledge.  Mid 5.10 moves lead through a finger crack and small roof.  Rap 90ft from a 2 bolt anchor. <br>   <br>  Try not too have too much terror in tiny town.</div><br /><img  class=\"\" src='https://cdn2.apstatic.com/photos/climb/9200193_smallMed_1557855002.jpg' alt=\"Trying to find a stance to place more tiny gear...\"><br><a href=\"https://www.mountainproject.com/area/105708958/idaho\">Idaho</a>\n        \n             &gt; <a href=\"https://www.mountainproject.com/area/112960923/south-idaho\">S Idaho</a>\n        \n             &gt; <a href=\"https://www.mountainproject.com/area/105739322/city-of-rocks\">City of Rocks</a>\n        \n             &gt; <a href=\"https://www.mountainproject.com/area/105739665/buzzard-perch\">Buzzard Perch</a>",

A small bulge is pulled and the crux finger crack is just above.  Figure out the tricky moves along a finger crack and you will arrive at a ledge with 2 bolts.
